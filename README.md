# Simple Restful API Boilerplate

This repository provides a boilerplate codebase for building a simple RESTful API with any database implementation. It aims to provide a starting point for developers to quickly set up a basic API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

## Prerequisites

To use this boilerplate, you need to have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simpleRestfulAPI.git

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd simpleRestfulAPI
   npm install

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start

 The API server will now be running at http://localhost:3000.
